<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Instruction Priority

Superpowers skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) - highest priority
2. **Superpowers skills** - override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** - lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, or AGENTS.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you-follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In Copilot CLI:** Use the `skill` tool. Skills are auto-discovered from installed plugins. The `skill` tool works the same as Claude Code's `Skill` tool.

**In Gemini CLI:** Skills activate via the `activate_skill` tool. Gemini loads skill metadata at session start and activates the full content on demand.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.

## Platform Adaptation

Skills use Claude Code tool names. Non-CC platforms: see `references/copilot-tools.md` (Copilot CLI), `references/codex-tools.md` (Codex) for tool equivalents. Gemini CLI users get the tool mapping loaded automatically via GEMINI.md.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

## Explicit-Only Exception

`brainstorming` is opt-in only.

- Invoke `brainstorming` only when the user explicitly names the skill.
- Accepted explicit forms include `brainstorming`, `superpowers:brainstorming`, `use the brainstorming skill`, and `call the brainstorming skill`.
- Do not infer a `brainstorming` request from planning, ideation, or "help me think through this" language.
- Do not invoke `brainstorming` just because the task is creative, ambiguous, or would benefit from design exploration.
- If `brainstorming` could help but was not explicitly requested, continue normally and optionally suggest it.
- All other skills still follow normal matching rules unless they define their own explicit-only exception.

digraph skill_flow {
    "User message received" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Brainstorming explicitly requested?" [shape=diamond];

    "User message received" -> "Brainstorming explicitly requested?";
    "Brainstorming explicitly requested?" -> "Invoke Skill tool" [label="yes"];
    "Brainstorming explicitly requested?" -> "Might any non-brainstorming skill apply?" [label="no"];
    "Might any non-brainstorming skill apply?" -> "Invoke Skill tool" [label="yes, even 1%"];
    "Might any non-brainstorming skill apply?" -> "Respond (including clarifications)" [label="definitely not"];
    "Invoke Skill tool" -> "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'";
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" -> "Has checklist?";
    "Has checklist?" -> "Create TodoWrite todo per item" [label="yes"];
    "Has checklist?" -> "Follow skill exactly" [label="no"];
    "Create TodoWrite todo per item" -> "Follow skill exactly";
}
```

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP-you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept != using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Explicitly requested skills first** - the user named a specific workflow
2. **Other process skills next** (debugging, verification) - these determine HOW to approach the task
3. **Implementation skills last** - these guide execution

`brainstorming` does not run by default.
It only runs when the user explicitly names the skill.

"Use the brainstorming skill for this feature" -> brainstorming first.
"Let's build X" -> choose other matching skills; do not auto-invoke brainstorming.
"Fix this bug" -> debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
